================================================================================
NOTES FOR AUTOMATION
================================================================================

TROLL COMBAT:
- Combat is RNG-based; troll typically dies in 2-4 successful hits
- I included 8 attack commands to account for misses
- If troll dies early, extra attack commands produce "I don't see any troll here"
- If script fails, increase attack count to 10-12
- Alternative: Use "kill troll with sword" (synonymous)

LAMP MANAGEMENT:
- Lamp has ~330 turns of battery life
- Turn off above ground to conserve (turn off lamp after "pray")
- Not strictly necessary for this sequence but good practice

ITEMS IN INVENTORY AT END:
- Brass lantern (off)
- Nasty knife
- Gold coffin
- Sceptre (inside coffin or separate)
- Pot of gold

ALTERNATE COMMANDS (synonyms that work):
- "enter" instead of "w" after opening window
- "kill" instead of "attack"
- "take" instead of "get"
- "climb down" instead of "d" after tying rope
- "get gold" or "take pot of gold" instead of "get pot"

POTENTIAL FAILURE POINTS:
1. Troll kills you - increase attack count or save/restore
2. Thief steals items - random encounter, restart if critical
3. Lamp dies - shouldn't happen in this short sequence
4. Wrong maze turn - not applicable to this route

================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS
