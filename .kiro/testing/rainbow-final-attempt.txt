West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

the windows are boarded.

corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 3

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.
A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.
On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

Living Room

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 15

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 16

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

> Cellar                                           Score: 35       Moves: 17

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 18

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 19

The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart: He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 20

have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.

Dome Room
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another
room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which
circles the dome.

Temple
This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient
inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is
a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north
end of the room is through huge marble pillars.
There is a brass bell here.

Altar
This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be
an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness.
You probably could not get back up it.
On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.

east and west.

> Canyon View                                      Score: 44       Moves: 46

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a
marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the
canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead
Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls
may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a
great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest,
stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb
down into the canyon from here.

> Rocky Ledge                                      Score: 44       Moves: 47

Rocky Ledge
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see
from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it
is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is
more cliff, which appears climbable.

> Canyon Bottom                                    Score: 44       Moves: 48

Canyon Bottom
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The
lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a
narrow path.

> End of Rainbow                                   Score: 44       Moves: 49

End of Rainbow
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the
Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river
canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the
falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.

> End of Rainbow                                   Score: 44       Moves: 50

Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture, walkable (I think
the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
A shimmering pot of gold appears at the end of the rainbow.

> End of Rainbow                                   Score: 54       Moves: 51
