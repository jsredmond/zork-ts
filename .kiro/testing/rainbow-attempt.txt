West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

> North of House                                   Score: 0        Moves: 1

North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 2

Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one
corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 3

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

> Kitchen                                          Score: 10       Moves: 4

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 5

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

Living Room

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 11

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 12

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 13

The brass lantern is now on.

> Cellar                                           Score: 35       Moves: 14

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

> East of Chasm                                    Score: 35       Moves: 15

East of Chasm
You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A
narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

> Gallery                                          Score: 35       Moves: 16

Gallery
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with
exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far
wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

> Gallery                                          Score: 39       Moves: 17

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 20

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 21

The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift and not having
the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 22

The troll fends you off with a menacing gesture.
The troll swings his axe, but it misses.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 23

You can't see any coffin here!
The flat of the troll's axe hits you delicately on the head, knocking you out.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 24

You can't see any sceptre here!
The troll swings his axe, but it misses.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 39       Moves: 25

The troll fends you off with a menacing gesture.
The troll's axe barely misses your ear.

Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

> Cellar                                           Score: 39       Moves: 27

You can't go that way.
