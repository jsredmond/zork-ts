West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

> Forest Path                                      Score: 0        Moves: 2

Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south
here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of
the path.

Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The
nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently
scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and
ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is
hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely
fragile.
