West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

> North of House                                   Score: 0        Moves: 1

North of House
You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 2

Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one
corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 3

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

> Kitchen                                          Score: 10       Moves: 4

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 5

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 6

Taken.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 8

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 9

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 10

The brass lantern is now on.

> Cellar                                           Score: 35       Moves: 11

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 12

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
The flat of the troll's axe skins across your forearm.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 13

Clang! Crash! The troll parries.
The troll's axe barely misses your ear.

> Forest                                           Score: 25       Moves: 14

Your sword misses the troll by an inch.
The troll's axe removes your head.
It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you are dead.

    ****  You have died  ****

Now, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I
can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.

Forest
This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be
sunlight.

Forest Path
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south
here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of
the path.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

south.
On the ground is a pile of leaves.
