You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east

A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

dusty cover of a closed trap door.

The unconscious troll cannot defend himself: He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
