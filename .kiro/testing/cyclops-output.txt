door.
There is a small mailbox here.

corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

> Behind House                                     Score: 0        Moves: 3

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 14

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

> Living Room                                      Score: 10       Moves: 15

darkness.

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 17

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

The unconscious troll cannot defend himself: He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

> The Troll Room                                   Score: 35       Moves: 20

Maze
This is part of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. A skeleton,
probably the remains of a luckless adventurer, lies here.
Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
The deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.
There is a skeleton key here.
An old leather bag, bulging with coins, is here.

> Maze                                             Score: 35       Moves: 30

Maze
This is part of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
A "lean and hungry" gentleman just wandered through, carrying a large bag.
Finding nothing of value, he left disgruntled.

Cyclops Room
This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks
the staircase. From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you
gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

> Cyclops Room                                     Score: 35       Moves: 34

knocking down the wall on the east of the room.
Your sword is no longer glowing.
